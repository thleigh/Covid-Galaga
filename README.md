# Covid-Galaga
This is my version of Galaga that is relevant to 2020. It was made purely with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Greetings!
Welcome to Covid-19 Galaga! Growing up, I have always had the priviledge of being immersed in video games. My family was able to buy me and my brother all of the new consoles that came out. Most found to my memory, the Playstation 3. However, even though I always had the consoles with the best graphics and playability, there was always one game that I would play no matter what: Galaga. I loved the simplicity and the thrill that it had despite being so pixelated and old (to me). 
With that being said, I wanted to challenge myself and make my own version of Galaga as a game project for my General Assembly bootcamp. Additionally, I wanted to make it relevant with the times (2020). At the moment, we are not fighting alien invaders, however, we are fighting a deadly virus. 
So join along in my journey of recreating my childhood and maybe yours too!
