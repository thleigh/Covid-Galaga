# Covid-Galaga
This is my version of Galaga that is relevant to 2020. It was made purely with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Greetings!
Welcome to Covid-19 Galaga! Growing up, I have always had the priviledge of being immersed in video games. My family was able to buy me and my brother all of the new consoles that came out. Most found to my memory, the Playstation 3. However, even though I always had the consoles with the best graphics and playability, there was always one game that I would play no matter what: Galaga. I loved the simplicity and the thrill that it had despite being so pixelated and old (to me). 
With that being said, I wanted to challenge myself and make my own version of Galaga as a game project for my General Assembly bootcamp. Additionally, I wanted to make it relevant with the times (2020). At the moment, we are not fighting alien invaders, however, we are fighting a deadly virus. 
So join along in my journey of recreating my childhood and maybe yours too!

### Day 1
The first step into the journey of my project was making the overlay to my game. I have immense experience with Adobe Photoshop so this came easy. I found all of the assets for my overlay and constructed a png with a classic Galaga design.
I finished this off with a "covid edition" at the top!
One of my main goals is to make this game accessible for mobile, so creating a responsive webpage was a big emphasis for me.

### Day 2
I  had a huge plan that I wanted to execute but it didn't go quite as planned. I had trouble adding a grid into my overlay and so instead, I made the grid first, using an older project game project that I waorked on with a pre-made grid to try to trouble-shoot it that way.
